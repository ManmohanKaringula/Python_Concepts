Important Note:
A scope is a textual region of a Python program where a namespace is directly accessible. “Directly accessible” 
here means that an unqualified reference to a name attempts to find the name in the namespace

Namespace hierarchy that the scope follows (LEGB):
1. Local Namespace (First Priority)
2. Enclosed Namespace (Second Priority, The namespace of enclosing function (nested function) is called enclosed namespace)
3. Global Namespace (Third Priority)
4. Built-in Namespace (Fourth Priority)
