If we are calling an already defined function then map() is a bit faster than the corresponding List Comprehension.

But when evaluating any other expression,List Comprehension is faster and clearer than map(), because the map incurs an extra function call for each element.

Some people prefer List Comprehension as they say it is a more pythonic and systematic way of coding.
