Process:
A process is an program/operation which can be runs on a CPU core
Thread:
The process can further be divided into small tasks known as threads. A process can have multiple threads to achieve 
concurrency

Parallelism vs Concurrency:
In Parallelism the various processes are executed on different cores of a CPU, but python doesn't support Parallelism
as GIL (global interpreter lock) prevents the processes to execute on more than a single core inorder to prevent the 
corruption of memory.

                process 1
            ---------------->  | core 1 }
                process 2               } CPU
            ---------------->  | core 2 }

Concurrency: In concurrency a single process is divided into many tasks known as threads, the threads are executed on a 
single core of a CPU one after other on overlapping time
