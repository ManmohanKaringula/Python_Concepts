The standard streams are similar to river streams, but instead of data there will be data flowing 
There are three types of standard streams:

1. stdout:
The stdout is used to send data to the output screen by default the stdout points to the monitor of the computer 
but we can change that to file or other destination of our choice

2. stdin:

3. stderr:
The stderr is used to print the error message onto the screen by default the stderr points to the monitor
