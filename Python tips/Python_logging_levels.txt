python has its own logging module to be imported inorder to use it, the logging is used when project size grows and the 
outputs generated by various functions/class methods are printed into a terget Log file with .log extension so that 
whenever an error occurs the log file can be used to detect errors.

>> There are four levels in python logging module:
1. DEBUG: Detailed information. typically of interest only when diagnosing problems.

2. INFO: Conformations that things are working as expected.

3. WARNING: An indication that something unexpected has happend, or indicative of some unexpected problems in the near 
   future (eg. disk space low). The software is not working as expected.

4. ERROR: Due to a more serious problem, the software has not been able to perform some functions.

5. CRITICAL: A serious error, indicating that the program itself may be unable to continue running.
