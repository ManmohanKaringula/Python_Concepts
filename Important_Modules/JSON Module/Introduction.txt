The json is also know as javascript object notation, here notation means a set of rules that are used to make text and these rules 
are derived from javascript object syntax, actually JSON is similar to the javascript object but the javascript objects can have 
some of the key values like "undefined" and functions whereas the JSON cannot have "Undefined" and functions as the key 
values

json:

{
"name":"manmohan"
"age":21
}

json is accepted by all of the major programming languages but javascript has upper hand on it even python has support for it
